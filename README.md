# Mini-Commerce - E-commerce Prototype
## Project Overview
Mini-Commerce is a client-side e-commerce prototype built with modern web technologies. It 

### allows users to:
 - Browse a catalog of products
 - Add items to their cart
 - View and modify their cart
 - Complete a mock checkout process

### View their order history
 All state persists across page reloads using localStorage, providing a seamless shopping experience without requiring backend infrastructure.

### Key Features:
- Product catalog with 8+ sample products
- Product detail pages
- Persistent shopping cart
- Checkout flow with order confirmation
- Order history tracking
- Responsive design for all devices

### Design Approach
- Layout & UI Components
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Card-based product displays for clear visual hierarchy
- Sticky header with persistent cart access
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Consistent spacing and padding for visual comfort

### - Responsiveness
- Breakpoints: Tailwind's default breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Fluid typography: Responsive font sizes
- Adaptive grids: Products shift from 1 to 4 columns based on screen width.
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

## Tools & Techniques
### Core Technologies
- Next.js 15 (App Router) - React framework
- TypeScript (strict mode) - Type-safe development
- Tailwind CSS v4 - Utility-first styling
- Zustand - State management
- React Query - Data fetching and caching

### Architectural Patterns
- Atomic design for component structure
- Container-presentational component pattern
- Custom hooks for business logic

## Testing
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests

## Development Tools
- ESLint + Prettier - Code quality and formatting
- TypeScript strict - No implicit any types
- React DevTools - State inspection
- React Query DevTools - Query inspection

## SEO Strategy
- Metadata
- Dynamic title and description per route
- Open Graph tags for social sharing

## Performance Optimizations
- Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Font optimization with next/font

## Error-Handling Technique
- Error Boundaries
- Global error boundary catches unhandled errors

## Data Fetching Errors
- React Query error states handled with fallback UI
- Suspense boundaries with loading states
- Empty states for missing data

## Form Validation
- Client-side validation with clear error messages
- Preventive checks before critical actions
- Toast notifications for operation feedback

## State Management
- Zustand middleware for error logging
- LocalStorage fallbacks when operations fail
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
